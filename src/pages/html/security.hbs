        <p>Apache NiFi welcomes the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. The NiFi team believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is crucial in identifying
            weaknesses in any technology. If you believe you've found a security issue in our product or service, we encourage you to notify us. We will work with you to resolve the issue
            promptly.</p>
        <h3>Disclosure Policy</h3>

                <td>A vulnerability is likely to be rated as Moderate if there is significant mitigation to make the issue less of an impact. This might be done because the flaw does not affect likely
                    configurations, or it is a configuration that isn't widely used, or where a remote user must be authenticated in order to exploit the issue.
